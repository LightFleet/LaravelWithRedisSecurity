# LaravelWithRedisSecurity

I upload this project because from time to time they ask me to demonstrate some interesting code on github

Here is an interesting project on Laravel in which custom security mechanisms are implemented using Redis. There is also VueJs and you can also look at the architectural boundaries within the application.

Of course, this project cannot be considered a fully representative case of my code, but I hope that technical specialists will understand this.
